# static inventory and group inheritance

# Main host list. Either:
# - set these manually OR
# - Leave empty and use another, dynamic inventory combined with this topology inventory file
# For S3 and S3-Admin calls only a single node is required, localhost will typically do as
# long as it can reach the S3 and Admin endpoints configured in group_vars/cloudian.
